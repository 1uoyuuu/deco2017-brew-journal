# Brew Image Fix Applied! 🖼️

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The brew images were showing placeholders because the database queries weren't selecting the `image_data` field from the related coffee records.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### **1. Updated `getBrews()` Function** ✅
- **Before**: Only selected `name` from coffees
- **After**: Now selects `name, image_data, processing_method, roasters, origins`

### **2. Updated `addBrew()` Function** ✅  
- **Before**: Only selected `name` from coffees
- **After**: Now selects `name, image_data, processing_method, roasters, origins`

## 📝 **Code Changes**

### **getBrews() Function**
```javascript
// Before
coffees:coffee_id(name),

// After
coffees:coffee_id(name, image_data, processing_method, roasters:roaster_id(name), origins:origin_id(country)),
```

### **addBrew() Function**
```javascript
// Before
coffees:coffee_id(name),

// After  
coffees:coffee_id(name, image_data, processing_method, roasters:roaster_id(name), origins:origin_id(country)),
```

## ✅ **Result**

Now when brews are loaded:
- **✅ Coffee image data** is properly fetched from the database
- **✅ Brew images** will display the actual coffee images
- **✅ All related data** (roasters, origins) is also available
- **✅ No more placeholders** in brew detail view

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**

The brew section should now display:
1. **Actual coffee images** instead of placeholders
2. **All brew details** with proper data relationships
3. **Rating as "4.0"** format as you requested

**The brew images should now be working correctly!** 🎉

**Please test the brew section to confirm the images are now displaying properly.**
